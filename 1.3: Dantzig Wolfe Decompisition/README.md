# Lagrangian Relaxation Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of the Lagrangian Relaxation method, a powerful technique for solving optimization problems with constraints. Lagrangian Relaxation works by iteratively solving a relaxed version of the original problem, where some constraints are relaxed and incorporated into the objective function using Lagrange multipliers.

## Introduction

Lagrangian Relaxation is a technique commonly used to solve optimization problems with both equality and inequality constraints. By relaxing some constraints and solving the relaxed problem iteratively, Lagrangian Relaxation often provides near-optimal solutions efficiently. It is particularly useful for large-scale optimization problems where direct solution methods may be impractical.
