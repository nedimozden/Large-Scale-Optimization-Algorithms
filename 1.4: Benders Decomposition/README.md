# Single Cut Benders' Decomposition and Multi-Cut Benders' Decomposition
This repository contains implementations of Single Cut Benders' Decomposition and Multi-Cut Benders' Decomposition, two powerful techniques used in mathematical optimization to solve large-scale optimization problems with both integer and continuous variables efficiently.

## Introduction
Benders' Decomposition is a method for solving mathematical optimization problems with a large number of variables and constraints by decomposing the problem into a master problem and a set of subproblems. Single Cut Benders' Decomposition adds a single feasibility cut at each iteration, while Multi-Cut Benders' Decomposition adds multiple cuts, leading to potentially faster convergence.
