# Cutting Stock Algorithm and K-pooling Cutting Stock

This repository contains implementations of the Cutting Stock Algorithm and its extension, K-pooling Cutting Stock, in Python. These algorithms are commonly used in operations research and optimization to efficiently cut raw materials into smaller pieces to satisfy demand while minimizing waste.

## Introduction

The Cutting Stock Algorithm is a classic optimization algorithm used in industries such as manufacturing, woodworking, and steel cutting, where raw materials (e.g., rolls of paper, steel sheets) need to be cut into smaller pieces to fulfill orders while minimizing leftover scraps. The basic Cutting Stock Algorithm aims to find the most efficient way to cut the raw material to meet the demand for various sizes of pieces.

K-pooling Cutting Stock is an extension of the Cutting Stock Algorithm that introduces the concept of pooling multiple orders together to optimize the cutting process. This helps in reducing setup times and improving efficiency, especially when dealing with a large number of orders with similar cutting requirements.
